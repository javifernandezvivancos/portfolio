This document is a summary which contains information about some of
my previous projects. I will explain all of these documents one by one. If you
are looking for some kind of specific project, please don't hesitate to request it
to me, maybe I've done something similar.

PROJECTS FOLDER:
– Project 1 Vphyton: A big phyton scene using Vphyton and math
functions, specifics drawing methods for random drawings, specific
curves (Bezier and C-ROM), illumination... I attach this project and some
screen shots about all the work.

– Project 2 Unity3D: This is a 3D Zuma style game coded on C# with
Unity3D . I developed this game for a psychologist who wanted to
improve some skills of his patients. The project is quite big and includes
skins, music.. and more media files which make the project quite big, if
it's necessary I can upload the project to a server. Also an .exe for
windows or any other platform. I just include here the scripts which
control some objects of the game. The balls are inside of a path which
control their movement, just a shot ball can destroy the other balls of the
path.

– Project 3 C++ qt: A program which manipulates pictures by code, using
the qt environment and C++. Analysis of pixels, masks, histogram
algorithms, color changes... in order to obtain different visual effects. I
attach some files of the source code, some screen shots are given too.

– Project 4 Java projects: 2 video games using all the advantages which
this language offers: interfaces, generic classes, abstract classes... all the
source code is given too. A project using sockets in order to send/receive
information about the processes involved in the software. It was a
simulation of the security software which a coal mine could have.

– Project 5 C++ examples: Some projects using different known
algorithms in IT engineering.
1- Backtracking
A problem solved using backtracking, the heart of the backtracking
is in the function "calcula"
2- Dynamic programming
2 problem solved using dynamic programming, the heart of the
algorithm is in the function "calcula" and "resolver"
3- Greedy algorithm
A problem solved using this technique.

– Project 6 Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop: In this folder I attach some
projects I've done using these programs. I attach just the final results
on .jpg and .pdf files, but all of them has been developed using vector
graphics.
– Project 7 Website using HTML5, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript:
This is a website developed during the exchange program I did in West
Virginia (USA). It was developed by a team of 3 members (including
myself). We worked by ourselves at home to after arrange meetings in
order to join all the job made during the week.

– Project 8 Flash game using HTML, XML and CSS:
This website includes an embedded flash game like “who wants to be
millionaire” programmed on action script. All the media is not included
because it would be really heavy to share it. That's why some features of
the game will not work properly (sounds, videos, images).

– Project 9 Tetris on MIPS architecture
This project is coded in the low-level programming language MIPS. Every
pieces are drawn in ASCII characters. For my co-worker and me the
challenge was to create good quality code in terms of CPU and memory
consumption. All the project is well documented in the pdf file attached.

– Project 10 SQL
These are a group of projects in SQL. We created a database and after we
made different queries in order to access specific data requested. We
also created a java program to access it by code using JDBC.
