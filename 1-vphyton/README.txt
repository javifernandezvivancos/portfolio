Project 1:
3D Beach coded on VPython-Win-Py2.5-5.03
For this project I coded a 3D scene using linear algebra: Bezier and CatMull-Rom algorithms in order to draw the lines of the trees, the fountain and
every object which need it. Other math techniques are performed too. for example, the fountain is made rotating a line around a central point. 
Also I coded a fractal algorithm to draw a mountain with different shapes each time the program is executed. Also different kind of algorithms are
perfermed to draw the different objects of the scene.
I include 3 pictures where the scene can be seen from different points of view. The source code is given too. Each .py file represents an object of 
the 3D scene programmed.
