Project 2:
3D Zuma style game coded on C# with Unity3D
I did this game for a psychologyst who wanted to improve some skills of his patients. The project is quite big and includes skins, music.. and more media files which make the project quite big, if it's necessary I can upload the project to a server, also an .exe for windows to be able to play. I just inlude here the scripts that control some objects of the game. The balls are inside of a path which control their movement, just a shot ball can destroy other balls of the path.
