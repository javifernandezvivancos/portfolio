Project 5:
Some C++ projects using different algorithm technics. (I know all the comments are in Spanish, I can translate them if it's neccesary)

1- Backtracking
	A problem solved using backtracking, the heart of the backtracking is in the function "calcula"

2- Dynamic programming
	2 problem solved using dynamic programming, the heart of the algorithm is in the function "calcula" and "resolver"

3- Greedy algorithm
	A problem solved using this technique.
